                    <p>Voice Assistant has made our lives a lot easier. A Voice Assistant can also be called as an
                        intelligent assistant. An intelligent personal assistant can help someone with basic tasks. They
                        often understand natural language and can help

                weather forecast.
                Intelligent
                personal assistants have access to a large amount of information on a device or online, which enables
                them
                to perform
                simple tasks.The long-term vision for voice assistants is to act as a smart bridge between humans and
                the
                vast knowledge and
                capacities which the internet delivers. Taking away the need to use any device or screen to interact
                with
                the internet,

                work
                at the same time, making us multitaskers. The most popular Voice assistants are Google Echo, Amazon
                Alexa,
                Microsoft Cortana, Apple Siri </p>

                        <p>An autopilot is a device used to guide an aircraft without direct assistance from the pilot.
                            Early autopilots were only
                            able to maintain a constant heading and altitude, but modern autopilots are capable of
                            controlling every part of the

                <p> flight envelope from just after take-off to landing.The autopilot system relies on a series of
                    sensors around the aircraft that pick up information like speed, altitude and
                    turbulence. That data are ingested into the computer, which then makes the necessary changes.
                    Basically, it can do
                    almost everything a pilot can do. Key phrase: almost everything.
                    Before takeoff, the pilot will enter the route into the computer, giving it a start and end position
                    and exactly how to
                    get there. Throughout that route there are a series of points that the computer will note, each

                    altitude.
                    The autopilot does not steer the airplane on the ground or taxi the plane at the gate. Generally,
                    the pilot will handle
                    takeoff and then initiate the autopilot to take over for most of the flight. In some newer aircraft
                    models, autopilot
                    systems will even land the plane. </p>
